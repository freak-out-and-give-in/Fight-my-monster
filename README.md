# Fight my monster
This is an attempted re-creation of the game 'Fight My Monster' (2011-2017).<br>
I have used the original website's images but have not used any of their source code (or even seen it).<br>
It is made in Java with Spring boot and uses these dependenices: Spring web, Thymeleaf, Spring security, Spring data JPA, MySQL Driver and ModelMapper<br>
